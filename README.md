## Tips for Being Successful
Source: http://www.inc.com/jordan-kasteler/7-freelance-habits-you-should-develop-before-quitting-your-day-job.html

1. Manage Your Time Efficiently: The most common habit successful freelancers develop is the ability to manage their time effectively. Find a tactic that works for you, and then use it as often as you may need, as long as it helps you manage your time.

2. Treat Yourself Right: There is always work to do. But forgetting that you're only human will lead to a mental break. So, don't forget to take breaks. Give yourself a day or two off periodically. Make sure you get out into the world. Do whatever you need to keep yourself in good spirits and good health.

3. Don’t Let Rejection Tear You Down: It's best to be prepared for the inevitable when becoming a serious freelancer. Simply being aware that rejection happens is a big first step. Many of these testing projects will have well defined requirements specifying geography (despite being conducted online), particular clients, etc. Keep in mind that your skills have worth, and you'll find a client who sees it as well.

4. Take Some Risks: Take on daunting projects. Challenge yourself to learn new things. If you don't go out there and try new things, your career will become stagnant.

5. Have Something Fun to Do: Whether a project for a client or one that you accomplish in your spare time, make sure you're doing something fun. This will help you keep your perspective, remind you why you started, and help you relax even when you're working.
Especially when beginning, freelancers can get caught up doing the same type of projects over and over. Not only is this damaging for a new portfolio, it's also boring and repetitive.
Repetitive jobs become harder to do--just because it's harder to keep focused on them. Make sure to (at least occasionally) take a job that sounds like fun.

6. Don’t Forget Why You Started: Don't forget that you started freelancing not because you had no choice, but because you love it.
In the business that develops, never forget your passion. If you do, it'll be worse than neglecting every other piece of advice out there.
No spark reflects in your work. If you lose your passion and love for your craft, not only will it be hard for you to continue to motivate yourself, but you'll start to put out lower quality work. This can be disastrous--so make sure you take time to remind yourself of your love for your work.

## [How to Get Started](https://www.utest.com/earning-money)
Step 1: Complete a Full uTest Profile

uTest matches projects to those testers who meet the specific customer criteria. By keeping your profile up-to-date, you increase the likelihood of getting invited to paid projects.

Step 2: Show us Your Skills

uTest invites testers to an audition -- called the uTest Sandbox -- so they can see how projects work, understand the uTest platform, and show off their skills.

[Sandbox 101](https://help.utest.com/sandbox/) - 
The uTest Sandbox 101 is a program that provides newly registered (or currently unrated) uTesters with the opportunity to evaluate uTest, and likewise an opportunity for uTest to evaluate new uTesters. This involves participating in an unpaid “audition” test cycle that closely mimics a regular, paid uTest test cycle.

Step 3: Further Sharpen Your Skills

uTest provides free [Courses](https://www.utest.com/courses). Taking these courses will ensure that you are primed for success when you begin to take on paid projects.

## [Test Cycle Types](https://www.utest.com/courses/skill-tree)
uTest offers several types of testing projects to appeal to many types of software testers.

There’s a section of your profile titled "Testing Settings" where you need to select at least one testing type (outlined below), and a section titled "Hardware & Software" where you must select at least one app type (Mobile, Web, etc). To match you with the best opportunities you are encouraged to select only the testing types you are familiar with or have had some experience in.

- Crowd Sourced Community Test Cycles:
  - Functional: Exploratory testing and test case completion
  - Usability: Survey completion
  - Localization: Translation validation and localization testing

- Expert Sourced Community Test Cycles:
  - Automation: Automated test script creation
  - Usability: Usability audits, survey creation, survey analysis and expert review
  - Security: Manual penetration and dynamic security testing
  - Load and Performance: Script creation and expert review

## [Tester Ratings](https://www.utest.com/courses/utest-tester-ratings)
How am I rated as a tester?

All testers are rated against other active members of the community based on their quality and activity level (tester rating calculations are performed on a daily basis). There are a total of five tiers for the rated tester: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Proven, and Rated tier (if you do not have a badge, this simply means that you have not filed enough "activity" points). Testers can be Gold in Functional testing, and be lower or even unrated in other testing types.

Gold/Silver/Bronze testers receive higher payout rates than other members of the testing community: Gold testers receive a 10% premium on all approved reports, while Silver and Bronze testers receive a 5% and 2.5% premium, respectively. Payout increases are determined by the rating that applies to the test cycle's testing type.

## [Testlio](https://testlio.com/)
![Testlio logo](Testlio/og-image.png)
[What's Testlio?](https://testlio.com/for-testers/)
- Testlio is based in San Francisco, CA and Tallinn, Estonia
- Testlio is a community of testers that help companies make sure their products work.
- Testlio emphasizes that Quality matters.

Testing shouldn’t be based off of the number of bugs you catch. What matters is the impact you have on the end product. Testlio values the quality of the bugs you find, rather than the quantity.

1. Get verified - Each tester goes through our verification process to make sure our community is made up of expert testers.
2. Crush bugs - Once you’ve been verified, you will be invited to a project you can work on around your own schedule.
3. Get paid - Make up to $35/hr for doing what you love. After each test cycle you will receive payment for the hours you’ve been assigned to test.

## [Tester FAQ](https://platform.testlio.com/tester-faq)
- What is Testlio?
- Why is this better?
- How do I get started/invited to a project?
- How much do I get paid?
- What's it like being a tester?
- How do the hours work?
- How do I get paid?
- Do you care what tools we use?
- What is my tester rating based on?

  Your tester rating is based on four factors:
    - Bug depth: How critical were the bugs you reported?
    - Timeliness: Did you submit the bugs on time?
    - Ability to follow directions: Were the bugs you submitted in the scope of the test cycle?
    - Report Quality: How clean and readable was your bug report? Could a five-year old reproduce the bug?

  After the test cycle is over a Test Lead will rate you on these four areas. The higher your score is, the better your chances of being invited to more test cycles.
