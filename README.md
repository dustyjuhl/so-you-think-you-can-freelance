# So You Think You Can Freelance

![Home Office](floatmonitors_picture.jpg)

Nobody's code is perfect, and all browsers don't run that code the exact same way. A developer can be staring at the weirdest issue ever with no clue where to begin troubleshooting. Sometimes, searching Stack Overflow for related issues can feel like an exercise in futility. A developer's mettle can be tested when this happens, so having the right tools and the proper mindset can mean the difference between a five minute fix, and an all-nighter. This repo will serve as a great place for storing tips for troubleshooting, list some great tools, as well as be reference point for new devs who are trying to level up their trouble shooting skill.  Please feel free to submit a PR for any extra tools or tips you think should be added to the list.

## Tips for Being Successful

1. Manage Your Time Efficiently: The most common habit successful freelancers develop is the ability to manage their time effectively. Find a tactic that works for you, and then use it as often as you may need, as long as it helps you manage your time.

2. Treat Yourself Right: There is always work to do. But forgetting that you're only human will lead to a mental break. So, don't forget to take breaks. Give yourself a day or two off periodically. Make sure you get out into the world. Do whatever you need to keep yourself in good spirits and good health.

3. Don’t Let Rejection Tear You Down: It's best to be prepared for the inevitable when becoming a serious freelancer. Simply being aware that rejection happens is a big first step. Many of these testing projects will have well defined requirements specifying geography (despite being conducted online), particular clients, etc. Keep in mind that your skills have worth, and you'll find a client who sees it as well.

4. Take Some Risks: Take on daunting projects. Challenge yourself to learn new things. If you don't go out there and try new things, your career will become stagnant.

5. Have Something Fun to Do: Whether a project for a client or one that you accomplish in your spare time, make sure you're doing something fun. This will help you keep your perspective, remind you why you started, and help you relax even when you're working.

Especially when beginning, freelancers can get caught up doing the same type of projects over and over. Not only is this damaging for a new portfolio, it's also boring and repetitive.
Repetitive jobs become harder to do--just because it's harder to keep focused on them. Make sure to (at least occasionally) take a job that sounds like fun.

6. Don’t Forget Why You Started: Don't forget that you started freelancing not because you had no choice, but because you love it.

In the business that develops, never forget your passion. If you do, it'll be worse than neglecting every other piece of advice out there.

No spark reflects in your work. If you lose your passion and love for your craft, not only will it be hard for you to continue to motivate yourself, but you'll start to put out lower quality work. This can be disastrous--so make sure you take time to remind yourself of your love for your work.
